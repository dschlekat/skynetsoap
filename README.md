# soap
SOAP (Skynet single-Object Aperture Photometry) allows users to easily conduct photometry on a single object with defined coordinates using the observation ID of the relevant Skynet observation. Once the photometry is complete, SOAP can create photometric tables, and brightness (in a variety of units) vs. time plots.
